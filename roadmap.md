# Portfolio & Freelancer Website Roadmap

## Overview
This project aims to build a modern, minimalist portfolio website using React. The website will showcase my skills, projects, and services as a freelancer. It will have both light and dark themes for better user experience.

## Key Features
- **Home Page**: A clean and professional landing page showcasing my introduction, skills, and call-to-action for projects or contact.
- **About Me**: Section highlighting my background, education, and career objectives.
- **Projects**: Display a list of projects with images, descriptions, and links to repositories.
- **Services**: Outline the freelance services I offer (web development, front-end, back-end, etc.).
- **Contact**: A form or CTA directing potential clients or employers to reach out.

## Technologies to Use
- **Frontend**: React.js, React Router (for navigation)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (for a responsive, mobile-first design), or styled-components (for more dynamic styling)
- **State Management**: Redux (for global state management), React Context API (for simpler state)
- **Theme Toggle**: Implement dark/light mode toggle with React context
- **Hosting**: Vercel (for seamless deployment)

## Milestones

### Phase 1: Setup & Basic Structure
- **Create React App**: Initialize the React project using `create-react-app` or Next.js if you prefer SSR (Server-Side Rendering).
- **Folder Structure**: Set up a clean folder structure:
  - `src/`
    - `components/`
    - `pages/` (if using Next.js)
    - `styles/`
    - `assets/` (images, icons, etc.)
    - `utils/` (for reusable helper functions)
- **Responsive Layout**: Use Tailwind CSS to ensure a responsive layout.
- **Theme Setup**: Implement a dark mode/light mode toggle using React Context API.

### Phase 2: Core Pages & Content
- **Home Page**: Add an introductory section with a professional photo or avatar, your name, and a tagline.
- **About Me Page**: Write a brief summary of your background and education.
- **Projects Page**: Display a grid of projects with thumbnail images, project titles, and brief descriptions. Link each project to its detailed page or GitHub repo.
- **Services Page**: List the services you offer as a freelancer (e.g., web development, front-end, back-end, etc.), along with rates if desired.

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- **Contact Form**: Set up a contact form to capture client inquiries, linked to an email service or database for follow-up.
- **Animations & Transitions**: Use CSS or libraries like Framer Motion to animate components for smooth interactions.
- **SEO & Performance**: Optimize the website for search engines and ensure fast load times.

### Phase 4: Final Touches
- **Resume/CV**: Include a downloadable version of your resume in PDF format.
- **Social Links**: Add links to your social profiles (LinkedIn, GitHub, Instagram).

## Optional Enhancements
- **Blog CMS**: If you want a more complex blog system, consider using a headless CMS like Strapi or Contentful.
- **Portfolio Filtering**: Implement project filtering by category (e.g., front-end, back-end, full-stack).
- **E-commerce (if relevant)**: If you offer freelance products or digital downloads, add a payment gateway like Stripe.

## Next Steps (Freelancer Focused)
- **Testimonials**: Add a section with testimonials or reviews from clients.
- **Pricing Page**: Include detailed pricing plans for different services (e.g., hourly, project-based).
- **Booking System**: Integrate a calendar for booking consultations or work hours.
- **Social Proof**: Showcase any collaborations, client logos, or successful case studies.

## Hosting & Deployment
1. **Deploy with Vercel**: Once the site is ready, deploy the website using Vercel for a fast, serverless deployment.
2. **Test & Review**: Ensure all links are functional, forms work, and the website is mobile-friendly.

## Maintenance & Updates
- Regularly update the portfolio with new projects, blog posts, or services.
- Keep track of client requests and feedback to continually improve the site.
