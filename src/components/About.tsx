        <p>
          Hello! I&apos;m Dainwi Choudhary, a Full-Stack Developer passionate
          about building scalable, high-performance applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          I specialize in modern web technologies including React, Next.js,
          Node.js, Express.js, and PHP, combined with databases such as MySQL,
          MongoDB, and PostgreSQL to deliver robust end-to-end solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond traditional web stacks, I integrate AI/ML capabilities and
          leverage REST APIs and GraphQL to create intelligent, data-driven
          applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          My focus is on writing clean, maintainable code and delivering
          seamless user experiences that balance performance with functionality.
        </p>
